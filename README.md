# :office: :question: Where shall we set up the new office?

:exclamation: :moneybag: Finding the optimal coordinates for the installation of a new office is a paramount element of a successful company. 

Here, we present a recommendation algorithm that provides tentative coordinates under an optimization criterion. 

The user needs to provide a set of antagonistic elements (e.g: competitive companies) and a number of synergetic elements (e.g:  collaborators). 

:mag_right: The algorithm will then utilize unsupervised clustering technique to suggest a location that maximizes the distance of the new office from the competitors, while minimizing the distance from the collaborators.
